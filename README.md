# Vue Custom Element Learning

*By Dennis Burger, April 2023*

## This demo web illustrates a few things:

* Two simple Vue Web Components below that require NO (frontend) build process. It's just 1 external JavaScript file that creates a (Vue) Web Component.
* Native Web Components also support attribute- and (named) slot data
* Web Components (when "closed") by default do NOT inherit or adhere to the CSS of their host page. Like an iFrame they have a closed scope.
* This web page uses CSS Custom Properties for its colors
* CSS Custom Properties DO natively propagate through to the Web Components that are on the web page
* This opens up a lot of possibilities for theming the Web Component
